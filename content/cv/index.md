## About Me

I am an Economic Geography graduate from the London School of Economics and Political Science. I am a former Business Analysis Intern at Amazon, and am currently looking for some high-impact data-driven work experience.

I am passionate about data-driven decision making, and increasing accessibility of key data points to non-technical users. In my free time, you can find me either on the golf course, or getting a haircut.
