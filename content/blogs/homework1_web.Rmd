# Data Manipulation

## Problem 1: Use logical operators to find flights that:

```{r}
#| label: problem-1

# Flights with an arrival delay of two or more hours (> 120 minutes)

flights %>% 
  filter(arr_delay >= 120)

# Flights that flew to Houston (IAH or HOU)

flights %>% 
  filter(dest == "IAH"| dest == "HOU")

# Flights operated by United (`UA`), American (`AA`), or Delta (`DL`)

flights %>% 
  filter(carrier %in% c("UA", "AA", "DL"))

# Flights that departed in summer (July, August, and September)
  
flights %>% 
  filter(month %in% c(7:9))
  
# Flights that arrived more than two hours late, but didn't leave late

flights %>% 
  filter(arr_delay > 120 & dep_delay <= 0) %>% 
  select(year:day, carrier, flight, arr_delay, dep_delay)

# Flights delayed by at least an hour, but made up over 30 minutes in flight

flights %>%
  filter(dep_delay >= 60 & arr_delay <= dep_delay + 30) %>% 
  select(year:day, carrier, flight, arr_delay, dep_delay)
```

## Problem 2: What months had the highest and lowest proportion of cancelled flights? Interpret any seasonal patterns. To determine if a flight was cancelled use the following code

<!-- -->

```{r}
#| label: problem-2

# First, I calculate the number of canclled flights, and the total number of flights. Then, I filter for only the minimum/maximum value, and select the appropriate values. 

# Finding the minimum number of cancelled flights

flights %>% 
  group_by(month) %>%
  summarise(count_total = n(), count_cancelled = sum(is.na(dep_time)), pct_cancelled = (count_cancelled/count_total)*100) %>%
  filter(pct_cancelled == min(pct_cancelled)) %>%
  select(month, pct_cancelled)

# Finding the maximum number of cancelled flights

flights %>% 
  group_by(month) %>%
  summarise(count_total = n(), count_cancelled = sum(is.na(dep_time)), pct_cancelled = (count_cancelled/count_total)*100) %>%
  filter(pct_cancelled == max(pct_cancelled)) %>%
  select(month, pct_cancelled)

# Combined dataframe for plotting

flights %>% 
  group_by(month) %>%
  summarise(count_total = n(), count_cancelled = sum(is.na(dep_time)), pct_cancelled = (count_cancelled/count_total)*100) %>%
  ggplot(aes(x=month, y=pct_cancelled)) +
  geom_line(size=1) +
  theme_light() +
  scale_x_continuous(limit = c(1,12), breaks = 1:12) +
  labs(title = "Percentage of flights cancelled", subtitle = "NYC departures in 2013", x = "Month", y = "% Cancelled") +
  NULL
```

> -   Lowest cancellation month: 10 (October), 0.82%
>
> -   Highest cancellation month: 2 (February), 5.05%
>
> -   Cancellations appear to be highest in February, the summer months, and December. This may coincide with peak travel seasons, where the flight network is strained by volume generating increased cancellation rates.

## Problem 3: What plane (specified by the `tailnum` variable) traveled the most times from New York City airports in 2013? Please `left_join()` the resulting table with the table `planes` (also included in the `nycflights13` package).

For the plane with the greatest number of flights and that had more than 50 seats, please create a table where it flew to during 2013.

```{r}

# Counting flights by tailnum, and joining to planes table

tailnum_depts <- flights %>%
                  group_by(tailnum) %>%
                  summarise(count = n(), na.rm = TRUE) %>%
                  arrange(desc(count)) %>%
                  select(tailnum, count)

head(tailnum_depts)

plane_depts <- left_join(tailnum_depts, planes, "tailnum") %>%
                filter(!is.na(tailnum))

plane_depts %>%
  arrange(desc(count))

# Finding the plane with greatest number of flights, and more than 50 seats

plane_depts %>% 
  filter(seats > 50, na.rm = TRUE) %>%
  arrange(desc(count))

# It's plane N328AA, a Boeing 767-223. Let's plot all of its flights

flights %>%
  filter(tailnum == "N328AA") %>%       # Finding all flights with our tailnumber
  group_by(dest) %>%                    
  summarise(flights_to = n()) %>%       # Counting flights per destination
  arrange(desc(flights_to))
```

## Problem 4: The `nycflights13` package includes a table (`weather`) that describes the weather during 2013. Use that table to answer the following questions:

```{r}

# Distribution of temperature in July 2013.

weather %>%
    filter(month == '7') %>% # Gathering July data only to perform a visual inspection
    select(temp) %>% 
    summary()

weather %>%
  filter(month == '7') %>%
  ggplot(aes(x=temp)) + # Plotting as density plot
  geom_density(size = 1) +
  labs(title = "Frequency plot of temperatures at NYC airports", subtitle = "July 2013") +
  theme_light() +
  NULL
```

> The above distribution is *somewhat* normally distributed, with a slightly longer right tail. (positive skew). The mean is 80.07, and the median is 70.98, confirming the positive skew observed in the frequency plot.

```{r}

# Outliers in wind_speed, opted for a boxplot to highlight outliers and manual identification thereafter. 

weather %>%
  filter(month == '7') %>%
  ggplot(aes(y=wind_speed)) +
  geom_boxplot() +
  labs(title = "Boxplot of wind speeds across NYC airports", subtitle = "July 2013") +
  theme_light() +
  NULL
```

> The outliers are:
>
> -   Hour 18, Day 23, Wind Speed 25.3
>
> -   Hour 19, Day 20, Wind Speed 24.2
>
> -   Hour 17, Day 20, Wind Speed 21.9

```{r}

## Relationship between `dewp` and `humid`

# First, I plot a scatterplot to check the overall trend.

weather %>%
  ggplot(aes(x=dewp, y=humid)) +
  geom_point(alpha = 0.2) +
  geom_smooth(method = lm) +
  theme_light() +
  NULL

# Does this apply to all months?

weather %>%
  ggplot(aes(x=dewp, y=humid)) +
  geom_point(alpha = 0.2) +
  facet_wrap(~ month) +
  geom_smooth(method = lm) +
  theme_light() +
  NULL

# Does this apply to all origin airports?

weather %>%
  ggplot(aes(x=dewp, y=humid)) +
  geom_point(alpha = 0.2) +
  facet_wrap(~ origin) +
  geom_smooth(method = lm) +
  theme_light() +
  NULL

weather %>%
  select(dewp, humid) %>%
  ggpairs()

reg_dewp_humid <- lm(dewp ~ humid, data = weather)
summary(reg_dewp_humid)
autoplot(reg_dewp_humid, 1:3)
```

> The first scatter plot shows a positive correlation between dewp and humid. To be precise, the correlation coefficient is 0.512, a relatively significant positive correlation.
>
> The following 2 plots show that this trend applies across all months and origin airports. This defends the robustness of said correlation.
>
> Finally, a quick linear regression shows, again, a positive relationship. Though, our R-Squared value is small since the model is rather unsophisticated. However, the correlations and regression show that there is a positive relationship between the variables, of which is *partly* causal.

```{r}

# Relationship between `precip` and `visib`?

weather %>%
  select(precip, humid) %>%
  ggpairs()

reg_precip_visib <- lm(precip ~ visib, data = weather)
summary(reg_precip_visib)
autoplot(reg_precip_visib, 1:3)
```

> There appears to be little to no trend correlation between precip and humid. The correlation plot shows that when precipitation is low, humidity can vary hugely. However, in order for precipitation to be high, there must be a high (above 50%) level of humidity. Hence, to an extent, one could say these are positively correlated in a non-linear fashion.

## Problem 5: Use the `flights` and `planes` tables to answer the following questions:

```{r}

# Planes missing manufacturing dates: 70

planes %>% 
  summarise(missing_years = sum(is.na(year)))

# Five most common manufacturers: Boeing, Airbus, Bombadier, Embraer, McDonnell

planes %>%
  group_by(manufacturer) %>% 
  summarise(number_of_planes = n()) %>% 
  arrange(desc(number_of_planes))

# Generating a list of all the planes, their repsective manufacturer, and manufactured year that departed from NYC in 2013.

tailnums_dept_nyc <- as.tibble(c(unique(flights$tailnum))) %>% 
  
  # Creating this as a tibble so that it can be joined later
  
  rename(tailnum = value)

planes_dept_nyc <- left_join(tailnums_dept_nyc, planes, "tailnum") %>%
  select(tailnum, manufacturer, year)
  
# Ditribution of manufacturer changed over time

planes_dept_nyc %>% 
  mutate(manufacturer = case_when( 
      manufacturer == "AIRBUS INDUSTRIE" ~ "AIRBUS",
      manufacturer == "MCDONNELL DOUGLAS" ~ "MCDONNELL",
      manufacturer == "MCDONNELL DOUGLAS AIRCRAFT CO" ~ "MCDONNELL",
      manufacturer == "MCDONNELL DOUGLAS CORPORATION" ~ "MCDONNELL",
      manufacturer == "BOEING" ~ "BOEING",
      manufacturer != c("AIRBUS INDUSTRIE", 
                        "MCDONNELL DOUGLAS", 
                        "MCDONNELL DOUGLAS AIRCRAFT CO", 
                        "MCDONNELL DOUGLAS CORPORATION", 
                        "BOEING") ~ "OTHER"
      )) %>% 
  
  # The code above renames the manufacturer variants into their generic names.
  
  group_by(year, manufacturer) %>% 
  summarise(planes_manufactured = n()) %>% 
  arrange(desc(planes_manufactured)) %>% 
  
  # Next step is to plot this
  
  ggplot(aes(x=year, y=planes_manufactured, color = manufacturer)) +
  geom_line(size = 2, alpha = 0.7) +
  scale_y_continuous(limits = c(0,150)) +
  theme_light() +
  labs(title = "Number of planes introducted by each manufacturer") +
  NULL
```

> -   70 planes are missing their manufacturing year on the planes table
>
> -   The five most common manufacturers are Boeing, Airbus, Bombadier, Embraer and McDonnell
>
> -   Boeing and McDonnell were the early market leaders, with essentially zero competition from any other manufacturer. That said, Airbus would soon enter as a major player, but not for very long - the data appears to show a decline in the European manufacturer's deliveries in the early 2000s. In the late 2000s, and into the 2010s, Boeing remains the strongest single manufacturer, but does face competition from other manufacturers - most likely for smaller aircraft.

## Problem 6: Use the `flights` and `planes` tables to answer the following questions:

```{r}

# Using the previous tibble, I filter out nulls, then select only the minimum year value

planes_dept_nyc %>% 
  filter(!is.na(year)) %>% 
  filter(year == min(year)) %>% 
  select(tailnum, year)

```

> The oldest plane to depart from NYC in 2013 was manufactured in 1956!

```{r}

# How many airplanes that flew from New York City are included in the planes table?

planes_dept_nyc # Values with nulls here were not included in the planes table, hence when they were joined from the flights table, they didn't receive values for manufacturer and year. So, we simply count them.

planes_dept_nyc %>% 
  summarise(null_manf = sum(is.na(manufacturer)), null_year = sum(is.na(year)), total_planes = n()) # This shows us that some planes do exist in the planes database without a year, so we need to check if all of them have manufacturer values in the next line of code.

planes %>% 
  summarise(null_manf = sum(is.na(manufacturer))) # None of them are missing a manufacturer, so we are safe to use the null manufacturing values to count the number of planes on the flights database, but not on the planes database.

planes_dept_nyc %>% 
  summarise(missing_from_planes = sum(is.na(manufacturer)), total = n(), pct_missing_from_planes = (sum(is.na(manufacturer))/n())*100)
```

> 722 planes that flew from NYC are missing from the planes table. That's 17.89%, not great!

## Problem 7: Use the `nycflights13` to answer the following questions:

```{r}

# First, it's important to understand if NA arr_delay values = 0, or cancelled flights. 

flights %>% 
  group_by(origin, month) %>% 
  filter(is.na(arr_delay)) # Looks like they're cancelled, I will remove them in the following steps. 

# Here, I have caluclated the median arrival delay for each origin airport.

flights %>% 
  group_by(origin, month) %>% 
  filter(!is.na(arr_delay)) %>% # Removing nulls as discussed
  summarise(median_arr_delay = median(arr_delay)) 

# Now let's look at an airline-by-airline basis, and plot for each month. 

flights %>% 
  group_by(origin, month, carrier) %>% 
  filter(!is.na(arr_delay)) %>% # Removing nulls as discussed
  summarise(median_arr_delay = median(arr_delay)) %>%
  ggplot(aes(x=month, y=median_arr_delay, colour = origin)) + # Now lets plot these on a line chart
  geom_line(size = 1, alpha = 0.5) +
  facet_wrap(~ carrier) +
  theme_light() +
  labs(title = "Median arrival delay for each airline and origin airport", x = "Median Arrival Delay", y = "Month") +
  scale_x_continuous(limit = c(1,12), breaks = 1:12, ) +
  NULL
```

## Problem 8: Let's take a closer look at what carriers service the route to San Francisco International (SFO). Join the `flights` and `airlines` tables and count which airlines flew the most to SFO. Produce a new dataframe, `fly_into_sfo` that contains three variables: the `name` of the airline, e.g., `United Air Lines Inc.` not `UA`, the count (number) of times it flew to SFO, and the `percent` of the trips that that particular airline flew to SFO.

```{r}

# First, lets join the two tables so that we have all the neccessary data avaialable

carriers_to_sfo <- left_join(flights, airlines, "carrier") %>% 
  
  # Now let's group by carrier name for the upcoming analysis
  
  group_by(name) %>% 

  # Filtering out non-SFO flights to count trips by airline
  
  filter(dest == "SFO") %>% 
  summarise(count = n())

  # Now lets take a step back to count total flights by each airline

carriers_total <- left_join(flights, airlines, "carrier") %>% 
  group_by(name) %>% 
  summarise(total_flights = n())

# Building the final table

fly_into_sfo <- left_join(carriers_total, carriers_to_sfo, "name") %>% 
  mutate(count = case_when(
           is.na(count) ~ 0, 
           
           # Changing NAs to zero for clarity
           
           TRUE ~ count
         ),
         percent = count/total_flights*100,
         percent = round(percent, digits = 2)) %>% 
  select(name, count, percent) %>% 
  arrange(desc(percent))

```

And here is some bonus ggplot code to plot your dataframe

```{r}
#| label: ggplot-flights-toSFO
#| message: false
#| warning: false

fly_into_sfo %>% 
  
  # sort 'name' of airline by the numbers it times to flew to SFO
  mutate(name = fct_reorder(name, count)) %>% 
  
  ggplot() +
  
  aes(x = count, 
      y = name) +
  
  # a simple bar/column plot
  geom_col() +
  
  # add labels, so each bar shows the % of total flights 
  geom_text(aes(label = percent),
             hjust = 1.2, 
             colour = "white", 
             size = 3)+
  
  # add labels to help our audience  
  labs(title="Which airline dominates the NYC to SFO route?", 
       subtitle = "as % of total flights in 2013",
       x= "Number of flights",
       y= NULL) +
  
  theme_minimal() + 
  
  # change the theme-- i just googled those , but you can use the ggThemeAssist add-in
  # https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/ggThemeAssist/index.html
  
  theme(#
    # so title is left-aligned
    plot.title.position = "plot",
    
    # text in axes appears larger        
    axis.text = element_text(size=10),
    
    # title text is bigger
    plot.title = element_text(size=18)
      ) +

  # add one final layer of NULL, so if you comment out any lines
  # you never end up with a hanging `+` that awaits another ggplot layer
  NULL
 

```

## Problem 9: Let's take a look at cancellations of flights to SFO. We create a new dataframe `cancellations` as follows

```{r}

cancellations <- flights %>% 
  
  # just filter for destination == 'SFO'
  filter(dest == 'SFO') %>% 
  
  # a cancelled flight is one with no `dep_time` 
  filter(is.na(dep_time))

```

I want you to think how we would organise our data manipulation to create the following plot. No need to write the code, just explain in words how you would go about it.

![](images/sfo-cancellations.png)

```{r, fig.width=8, fig.height=4}

# Here's the code for the above plot:

# First, let's group the data by month, carrier, and origin and count.

cancellations %>% 
  group_by(month, carrier, origin) %>% 
  summarise(count = n(), .groups = "drop") %>% 
  
  # Let's get the airline names and month names to replicate the plot axes. 
  
  left_join(y=airlines,by = "carrier") %>% 
  mutate(month = case_when(
    month == 1 ~ "Jan",
    month == 2 ~ "Feb",
    month == 3 ~ "Mar",
    month == 4 ~ "Apr",
    month == 5 ~ "May",
    month == 6 ~ "Jun",
    month == 7 ~ "Jul",
    month == 8 ~ "Aug",
    month == 9 ~ "Sep",
    month == 10 ~ "Oct",
    month == 11 ~ "Nov",
    month == 12 ~ "Dec",
  ),
  month = factor(month, levels = c("Jan", "Feb", "Mar", "Apr", "May", "Jun", "Jul", "Aug", "Sep", "Oct", "Nov", "Dec"))) %>% # Ordering the monhts for the x-axis. This gave me some trouble, I think R doesn't recognise abbreviated months?
  
  # Now let's plot it. Trying to replicate the above plot as accurately as possible. 

  ggplot(aes(x=month, y=count)) +
  geom_bar(stat = "identity") +
  geom_text(aes(label = count), vjust = 1.5, size = 2, color = "white") + 
  facet_grid(row = vars(name), col = vars(origin)) +
  labs(title = "Cancellation of flights to SFO by month, carrier, and airport origin",x = NULL, y = NULL) +
  theme_bw() +
  NULL

# To explain the data organisation:
# - First we group by month, carrier, and origin so that our counting of cancellation is executed under the appropriate conditions.
# - We then need to order the months correctly, to preserve chronology.
```

## Problem 10: On your own -- Hollywood Age Gap

```{r}

age_gaps <- readr::read_csv('https://raw.githubusercontent.com/rfordatascience/tidytuesday/master/data/2023/2023-02-14/age_gaps.csv')
